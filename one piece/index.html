          Marineford becomes the stage for the war between the Marines and
          Whitebeard’s pirates, who fight to rescue Ace before his execution.
          The battle is filled with powerful clashes between legendary figures
          like Whitebeard, Admirals, and Warlords. Despite their efforts, Ace is
          killed, and Whitebeard also falls, marking the end of an era. This war
          dramatically changes the balance of power across the seas.

          The Straw Hats ally with the samurai of Wano to overthrow Kaido, one
          of the Four Emperors. Wano is a land isolated under Kaido and Orochi’s
          tyrannical rule. The alliance stages a rebellion, leading to an epic
          battle at Onigashima. Luffy awakens new powers, and Kaido is finally
          defeated, liberating Wano. This victory reshapes the power dynamics of
          the world.
